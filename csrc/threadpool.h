/*  threadpool.h – Minimal pthread-based worker pool for parallel-for.
 *
 *  Design:
 *    • N-1 background worker threads + the calling thread participates as
 *      tid=0. No external deps beyond POSIX pthreads (libSystem on macOS,
 *      glibc on Linux).
 *    • Fork-join semantics: pk_parallel() returns only after all workers
 *      finish the current job.
 *    • A process-wide singleton pool is provided via pk_pool() and is
 *      lazy-initialised on first use. Thread count: clamp(PK_THREADS env
 *      var, 1, PK_MAX_THREADS) defaulting to NPROCS_ONLN.
 *    • Callers serving many concurrent sessions can additionally create
 *      independent pools with pk_pool_create() and select one per thread
 *      with pk_set_pool() — pk_pool() returns the thread-local override
 *      when set. This avoids the pk_parallel dispatch-mutex serialising
 *      cross-session encoder calls.
